  The Luby sequence is a sequence of natural numbers defined recursively.
  It is used in randomized algorithms and has applications in computer science.
  The sequence is defined as follows:
```
  L(k ≥ 1) = 2^(i-1)          if k = 2^i - 1 for some i ≥ 0,
           = L(k+1 - 2^(i-1)) if 2^(i-1) ≤ k ≤ 2^i - 1
```
If we want to start the sequence from 0, to make the mapping a total function:
```
  L(k ≥ 0) = 2^(i-1)          if k = 2^i - 2 for some i ≥ 0,
           = L(k+2 - 2^(i-1)) if 2^(i-1) ≤ k + 1 ≤ 2^i - 1
```
Or
```
  L(k ≥ 0) = 2^(I(k)-1)          if (k + 2) &&& (k + 1) = 0,
           = L(k+2 - 2^(I(k)-1)) otherwise
```
where
  I(n) = ⌈log₂(n+2)⌉

Checks whether `n` is an "envelope" position in the Luby sequence.

An envelope is a position where the Luby sequence reaches a local maximum value.
Specifically, `n` is an envelope if `S₂ (n + 2) = n + 2`, which corresponds to
positions `n = 2^i - 2` for some `i ≥ 1`. At these positions, the Luby value
equals `2^(i-1)`, the largest power of 2 in the current segment.

For example, envelopes occur at positions 0, 2, 6, 14, 30, ... (i.e., `2^i - 2`).

/--
The Luby sequence, a well-founded recursive function computing `L(n)`.

The Luby sequence is defined as:
- `luby n = S₂ n` if `n` is an envelope (i.e., `is_envelope n = true`)
- `luby n = luby (n + 1 - S₂ n)` if `n` is not an envelope

The first 16 values (indices 0-15) are: 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 1, ...

The sequence is used in randomized algorithms, particularly for restart strategies
in SAT solvers and other optimization problems, where it provides a balance between
short and long runs.

Checks whether position `n` is at the beginning of a segment in the Luby sequence.

A segment beginning is a position where the Luby value equals 1.
The Luby sequence can be viewed as a concatenation of segments where each segment
has a length determined by the trailing zeros of the segment index.
Positions 0 and 1 are always segment beginnings. For `n ≥ 2`, a position is a
segment beginning if it is not an envelope and recursively maps to a segment
beginning after subtracting the current envelope value `S₂ n`.

Returns `true` if `n` is either 0, 1, or maps to a segment beginning after folding.
